# Blackjack
## Instalation and running the code
Thsi project is written on Python 3.0 with the pygame module. For it to work you need to install the module. I use VSCode as an interpreter and pip as an installer. So in the VSCode terminal you just write:

`pip install pygame`

## Description
In this project I have written all the basic blackjack moves except the split. For more information on the game - [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). There is also a hint button to help you if you don't know what move to make. The project has a statistic tracking mechanic to check your progress.

## Using the GUI
After you start the application you have to enter an integer in the bet text box. Than you click enter and can start the game by clicking deal. Then you make your moves. If you don't know what to do click hint.
